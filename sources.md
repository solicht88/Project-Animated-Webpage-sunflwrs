## Sources

### Reminders

* In this course, getting some help from online sources (including ChatGPT) is okay as long as you acknowledge them and indicate which lines of code you copied.
* In this course, getting help from other people is okay as long as you are not copy-pasting their code and you are doing all the typing.
* In this course, it is considered cheating if you send someone your entire program or let them take a picture of your program.
* In this course, it is considered cheating if you copy large amounts of code from your peers or get someone to do all the work for you.
* Each project file has a file history that can be used to easily determine excessive copy/pasting.
* Lying about your sources (e.g. saying you didn't get help when you actually did) can lead to disciplinary actions.

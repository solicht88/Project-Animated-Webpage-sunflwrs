* The HTML file includes at least two ids and/or classes
* The CSS file includes at least two stylings
* The JavaScript file includes:
  * at least one array
  * at least one loop
  * at least two custom functions
* Your name is continuously displayed at one of the bottom corners of the webpage
* The program runs without any syntax or runtime errors
* Your program still works when the screen size is different
